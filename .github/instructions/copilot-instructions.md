This project will contain PowerShell scripts that are used to gather information about Azure Local clusters.
These scripts can be run locally on nodes, or via Azure PowerShell, depending on the needed commandlets.

All code should be developed to be re-usable, so paramaters and variables should be used instead of hardcoded values.

Complex code should be built using functions, but simpler code can be function-less.
